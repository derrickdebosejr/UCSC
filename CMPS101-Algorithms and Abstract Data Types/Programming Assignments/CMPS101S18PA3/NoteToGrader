My methods to make a new Anagram use a constructor that takes in an array of char or a string and assigns a prime number to each letter and the product of the primes creates a unique factorization and the product is used as the key to compare if words are Anagrams.

The print method just returns the string of the anagram that was passed in, and can simply be put in a println statement

The compare method compares 2 anagrams passed in as parameters and compares if the 2 anagrams have the same key and runs in O(1) time.
