The default constructor creates a new Vector with no magnitude.

The constructor that takes in an x and a y coordinate for the Vector and computes angle and magnitude.

The polarVector ‚Äùconstructor" takes an angle and a magnitude for the Vector and solves for x and y values of the Vector

getX() Returns the x coordinate of the Vector.

getY() Returns the y coordinate of the Vector.

getAngle() Returns the angle of the Vector.

getMagnitude() Returns the magnitude of the Vector.

add(Vector other) Returns the sum of this Vector with the given Vector.

subtract(Vector other) Returns the difference between this Vector and the given Vector.

dotProduct(Vector other) Returns the dot product of this Vector and the given Vector.

scalarMultiply(float scalar) Returns this Vector scaled by the given scalar.

normalize() Returns the normalized version of this Vector, a Vector with the same angle with magnitude 1.


Additional Functionality:
 
crossProduct(Vector other) Returns a vector that is the cross product to this Vector and the given Vector. The cross product is tangent to both. The formula is (ad,-bc) where this Vector is (a,b) and the given Vector is (c,d).

determinant(Vector other) Returns a float that is the determinant of this Vector and the given Vector. The formula is ad-bc=determinant where this Vector is (a,b) and the given Vector is (c,d)

print() Returns a string of this vector as (x,y)
