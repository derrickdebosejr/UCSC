Apint methods

The 3 creation methods are newApint, newApintStr, NewApintInt.

newApint allocates memory for the paint structure.

newApintStr takes a string of integers and stores the data into the apint ADT with the allocated memory from newApint

newApintInt takes a integer and converts it to a string and stores the data into the apint ADT with the allocated memory from newApint

The add method in my code starts at the back of the list we add the 2 ints and then calculate carry based on the sum. The result stores the sum.

The subtract method in my code first determines which number is bigger in size. If the second number is larger than the first then we will subtract the second number from the first and set the difference to negative. We subtract a-b when a>b and b-a when b>a. The difference is a-b = result.

The multiply method first determines which number is bigger in size. Total is calculated by multiplying the 2 apints and adding by the carry at that index then uses a shift method to shift the data in order for there to be zeros at the end to hold the long multiplication process. The arguments passed in are a x b = result and the total apint is an empty apint that is used to be passed into the shift method

The shift method to shift the data in order for there to be zeros at the end to hold multiplication process. Method used in the multiply function to add b zeros to the end of the apint.

The print method checks if the apint passed in is zero and will print out zero otherwise prints out the number and removes all the leading zeros in the apint.
