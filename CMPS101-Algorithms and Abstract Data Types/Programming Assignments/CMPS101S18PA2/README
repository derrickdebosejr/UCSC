apint.c is the file that is the Apint ADT that creates apints from strings or ints and can manipulate the data with methods to add, subtract, and multiply the numbers. and can print out the apint to the system

apint.h is the header file to apint.c and has the prototypes to the apint.c methods

PA2.c this is the main code that tests the Apint ADT and uses the print, add, subtract, and multiply methods.

Makefile used to compile the code

README Current file to explain the files in directory
