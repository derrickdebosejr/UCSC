I worked on this lab 3 by myself. I took notes in class and went to MSI and 
also took notes there. These notes and with help from Chapter 3 in the
textbook I was able to complete the Lab. 
The files in this lab include :
FileReverse.java
Makefile
README
FileReverse.jar
gettysburg.txt
gettysburg-reverse.txt
out.txt
