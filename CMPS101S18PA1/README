apint.java the class apint has methods to add subtract multiply and divide but the character limit for the numbers is 3000 rather than  the number 2,147,483,647.
 
aprat.java the class aprat has methods to add subtract multiply and divide that expresses 2 apints as a numerator and denominator.

PA1.java This is my main code and reads in input.txt and writes to output.txt after completing the different arithmetic methods 

PA1.jar This class is used to make and compile the entire program

input.txt This text has the operations that I will be doing with the numbers

output.txt This text file is written into by PA1 after completing the operations of given from input.txt

Makefile used to compile the code

README Current file to explain the files in directory

NoteToGrader a short note to describe my approach.
